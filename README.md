# UrbanScope — Miriam Lobren Real Estate Agent

> **Better Homes, Brighter Futures**
> A responsive real estate website for property discovery, client inquiries, and admin management.

Built for **Miriam Lobren Real Estate Agent** (Las Piñas & Cavite, Philippines).

---

## ✨ Features

- **Property Showcase** — featured accredited listings (Casasuerte, Kathleen, Liora Homes, Airmen's Village Triplex) with category tabs, property photo galleries, in-page financing document previews, accurate zoomed-in location maps, and Total Contract Price (TCP) computations (Pag-IBIG & Bank Financing). Sold listings remain visible with a Sold Out label but no longer accept new inquiries.
- **Client Accounts & Google Sign-In** — registration with PH phone validation and password strength meter, plus one-click **Google Authentication** (OAuth 2.0 via Google Identity Services); unified sign-in that routes users by role.
- **Consultations & Inquiries** — interactive consultation intent flow allowing clients to book general consultations (free site tripping, loan pre-approval, property advice) or inquire about specific accredited listings, with client inquiry history tracking, cross-device notification synchronization, and a one-minute per-client cooldown after successful submissions.
- **Admin Dashboard** — KPI cards, inquiry charts, property CRUD, client inquiry tracking, and user overview.
- **Superadmin Console** — focused account and role governance, privileged-account overview, and database health checks. Property and inquiry workflows stay in the Agent Admin portal.
- **Administrative Access Control** — Vercel checks a signed, HttpOnly session before serving Admin and Superadmin pages. Hosted admin sign-in requires Google verification for an approved staff account; normal client sign-ins and editable browser storage cannot grant administrative access.
- **Legal & Privacy Hub** — comprehensive Terms of Service (aligned with RESA RA 9646) and Privacy Policy (compliant with Philippine Data Privacy Act RA 10173).
- **Responsive Design** — optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile, with a shared mobile navigation shell across public, client, Admin, and Superadmin pages. Public and client pages use the same primary links; Admin and Superadmin retain role-specific menus with consistent mobile drawers and touch targets.

## 📖 User & Administrator Manual

### 1. Client / Homebuyer Guide
- **Browsing Properties:** Visit the home page to view showcased listings, filter by property type (Houses, Townhouses, Lots, Commercial), or use search keywords. Click any property card to view high-resolution photos, pricing, lot/floor area, amenities, and location details.
- **Client Registration & Login:** Click **Sign In** in the top navigation bar. New users can create an account with a name, email, Philippine mobile number (`+63` / `09...`), and password, or register via **Sign up with Google**. Both manual account creation and Google OAuth registration require accepting the **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy** via an interactive scroll-to-accept agreement popup before proceeding. The system automatically signs you in and secures your session, while preserving form input drafts in real time.
- **Consultations & Dual-Mode Inquiries:** On the homepage, clicking **Book a Free Consultation** opens an interactive intent modal allowing clients to choose between *General Consultation / Question* (free site viewing, loan pre-approval, general advice) or *Inquire About a Specific Property* with dynamic listing selection, photo previews, and automated pricing details.
- **Inquiry History & Management:** Access **Inquiry History** via the client profile menu or topbar to track submitted requests, filter by status (*Under Review*, *Approved*, *Contacted*, *Cancelled*), view agent approval notices, modify inquiry messages or contact phones, cancel active requests, or permanently delete records.
- **Legal Compliance:** Review comprehensive, RESA-compliant Terms of Service and NPC-compliant Privacy Policy pages, fully integrated with seamless back navigation.

### 2. Administrator Guide (Miriam Lobren & Team)
- **Unified Sign-In:** Log in via `/pages/auth/login.html`. Authorized administrative accounts are automatically routed to the Admin Dashboard.
- **Shared Admin Navigation:** Dashboard, Properties, Clients, Inquiries, and Profile & Security use the same sidebar icons, section labels, active state, and UrbanScope green palette across admin screens.
- **Dashboard Overview & Inquiry Modal:** Monitor business health with key metrics: Total Properties, Total Inquiries, Pending Follow-ups, and recent activity streams. Click **View** on any inquiry to open an interactive modal with full message details, tour schedule, direct email reply, and instant **Approve Inquiry** action that immediately updates the client's inquiry history in real time.
- **Property Viewing Calendar:** Opens on today's browser-local date, marks the current day, supports month and date selection, and shows configured appointments plus client inquiry requests with preferred dates and times.
- **Managing Properties (CRUD):**
  - **View Listings:** Access `propertylist.html` to browse active catalog listings with status indicators.
  - **Add Property:** Click **Add New Property** (`add-property.html`) to input property name, category, price (₱), location, bedrooms, bathrooms, dimensions, amenities, and upload images.
  - **Edit Property:** Select **Edit** on any listing card (`edit-property.html`) to update pricing, specifications, or replace photos.
  - **Delete Property:** Remove unlisted or sold properties with immediate database and cache synchronization.
- **Client Inquiries & CRM:** Review client inquiries under `clients.html`, inspect contact information, track message details, approve client requests via the modal or inline select, and update inquiry follow-up statuses (e.g., *Under Review*, *Approved*, *Completed*).
- **Profile Picture Upload & Settings:** Visit `profile.html` to update contact details, change passwords, and upload custom profile photos (< 5MB limit) with automatic canvas optimization, live topbar avatar synchronization, and one-click photo reset. User account directory and role management are reserved for the Superadmin.

### 3. Superadministrator Guide
- **Console Navigation & Visuals:** The sidebar contains only Overview, Accounts & Roles, and System Health. Its navigation, icons, KPI tiles, and governance actions use the shared UrbanScope green treatment.
- **Master Overview:** Access `/pages/superadmin/dashboard.html` for account totals, privileged-role counts, and database storage status across local FastAPI/SQLite and cloud deployments.
- **Console Sections:** Use **Accounts & Roles** to manage user accounts and access levels, and **System Health** to run database integrity and role-trigger checks. Property listings and client inquiries are handled through the linked Admin Portal.
- **RBAC Role & Account Management:** Full user account governance (create client/admin accounts, edit full name, email, contact phone, account role `user`/`admin`/`superadmin`, promote/demote permissions, delete non-protected accounts, and a reset passwords) synchronized across local SQLite and Supabase Cloud with protected root superadmin credentials.
- **System Health:** Run live diagnostics on database storage, foreign-key/schema integrity, role triggers, and API connectivity.
